# Introduction

How do I manipulate tabular data that doesn’t fit into Random Access
Memory (RAM)?

Use `{disk.frame}`!

In a nutshell, `{disk.frame}` makes use of two simple ideas

1.  split up a larger-than-RAM dataset into chunks and store each chunk
    in a separate file inside a folder and
2.  provide a convenient API to manipulate these chunks

`{disk.frame}` performs a similar role to distributed systems such as
Apache Spark, Python’s Dask, and Julia’s JuliaDB.jl for *medium data*
which are datasets that are too large for RAM but not quite large enough
to qualify as *big data*.

## Installation

You can install the released version of `{disk.frame}` from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("disk.frame")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("xiaodaigh/disk.frame")
```

On some platforms, such as SageMaker, you may need to explicitly specify
a repo like this

``` r
install.packages("disk.frame", repo="https://cran.rstudio.com")
```

## Common questions

### a) What is `{disk.frame}` and why create it?

`{disk.frame}` is an R package that provides a framework for
manipulating larger-than-RAM structured tabular data on disk
efficiently. The reason one would want to manipulate data on disk is
that it allows arbitrarily large datasets to be processed by R. In other
words, we go from “R can only deal with data that fits in RAM” to “R can
deal with any data that fits on disk”. See the next section.

### b) How is it different to `data.frame` and `data.table`?

A `data.frame` in R is an in-memory data structure, which means that R
must load the data in its entirety into RAM. A corollary of this is that
only data that can fit into RAM can be processed using `data.frame`s.
This places significant restrictions on what R can process with minimal
hassle.

In contrast, `{disk.frame}` provides a framework to store and manipulate
data on the hard drive. It does this by loading only a small part of the
data, called a chunk, into RAM; process the chunk, write out the results
and repeat with the next chunk. This chunking strategy is widely applied
in other packages to enable processing large amounts of data in R, for
example, see [`chunkded`](https://github.com/edwindj/chunked)
[`arkdb`](https://github.com/ropensci/arkdb), and
[`iotools`](https://github.com/s-u/iotools).

Furthermore, there is a row-limit of 2^31 for `data.frame`s in R; hence
an alternate approach is needed to apply R to these large datasets. The
chunking mechanism in `{disk.frame}` provides such an avenue to enable
data manipulation beyond the 2^31 row limit.

### c) How is `{disk.frame}` different to previous “big” data solutions for R?

R has many packages that can deal with larger-than-RAM datasets,
including `ff` and `bigmemory`. However, `ff` and `bigmemory` restrict
the user to primitive data types such as double, which means they do not
support character (string) and factor types. In contrast, `{disk.frame}`
makes use of `data.table::data.table` and `data.frame` directly, so all
data types are supported. Also, `{disk.frame}` strives to provide an API
that is as similar to `data.frame`’s where possible. `{disk.frame}`
supports many `dplyr` verbs for manipulating `disk.frame`s.

Additionally, `{disk.frame}` supports parallel data operations using
infrastructures provided by the excellent [`future`
package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=future) to take advantage of
multi-core CPUs. Further, `{disk.frame}` uses state-of-the-art data
storage techniques such as fast data compression, and random access to
rows and columns provided by the [`fst`
package](http://www.fstpackage.org/) to provide superior data
manipulation speeds.

### d) How does `{disk.frame}` work?

`{disk.frame}` works by breaking large datasets into smaller individual
chunks and storing the chunks in `fst` files inside a folder. Each chunk
is a `fst` file containing a `data.frame/data.table`. One can construct
the original large dataset by loading all the chunks into RAM and
row-bind all the chunks into one large `data.frame`. Of course, in
practice this isn’t always possible; hence why we store them as smaller
individual chunks.

`{disk.frame}` makes it easy to manipulate the underlying chunks by
implementing `dplyr` functions/verbs and other convenient functions
(e.g. the `cmap(a.disk.frame, fn, lazy = F)` function which applies the
function `fn` to each chunk of `a.disk.frame` in parallel). So that
`{disk.frame}` can be manipulated in a similar fashion to in-memory
`data.frame`s.

### e) How is `{disk.frame}` different from Spark, Dask, and JuliaDB.jl?

Spark is primarily a distributed system that also works on a single
machine. Dask is a Python package that is most similar to
`{disk.frame}`, and JuliaDB.jl is a Julia package. All three can
distribute work over a cluster of computers. However, `{disk.frame}`
currently cannot distribute data processes over many computers, and is,
therefore, single machine focused.

In R, one can access Spark via `sparklyr`, but that requires a Spark
cluster to be set up. On the other hand `{disk.frame}` requires
zero-setup apart from running `install.packages("disk.frame")` or
`devtools::install_github("xiaodaigh/disk.frame")`.

Finally, Spark can only apply functions that are implemented for Spark,
whereas `{disk.frame}` can use any function in R including user-defined
functions.

# Example usage

## Set-up `{disk.frame}`

`{disk.frame}` works best if it can process multiple data chunks in
parallel. The best way to set-up `{disk.frame}` so that each CPU core
runs a background worker is by using

``` r
setup_disk.frame()

# this allows large datasets to be transferred between sessions
options(future.globals.maxSize = Inf)
```

The `setup_disk.frame()` sets up background workers equal to the number
of CPU cores; please note that, by default, hyper-threaded cores are
counted as one not two.

Alternatively, one may specify the number of workers using
`setup_disk.frame(workers = n)`.

## Quick-start

``` r
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(disk.frame))
library(nycflights13)

# this will setup disk.frame's parallel backend with number of workers equal to the number of CPU cores (hyper-threaded cores are counted as one not two)
setup_disk.frame()
#> The number of workers available for disk.frame is 6
# this allows large datasets to be transferred between sessions
options(future.globals.maxSize = Inf)

# convert the flights data.frame to a disk.frame
# optionally, you may specify an outdir, otherwise, the 
flights.df <- as.disk.frame(nycflights13::flights)
```

## Example: dplyr verbs

### dplyr verbs

{disk.frame} aims to support as many dplyr verbs as possible. For
example

``` r
flights.df %>% 
  filter(year == 2013) %>% 
  mutate(origin_dest = paste0(origin, dest)) %>% 
  head(2)
#>   year month day dep_time sched_dep_time dep_delay arr_time sched_arr_time arr_delay
#> 1 2013     1   1      517            515         2      830            819        11
#> 2 2013     1   1      533            529         4      850            830        20
#>   carrier flight tailnum origin dest air_time distance hour minute           time_hour
#> 1      UA   1545  N14228    EWR  IAH      227     1400    5     15 2013-01-01 05:00:00
#> 2      UA   1714  N24211    LGA  IAH      227     1416    5     29 2013-01-01 05:00:00
#>   origin_dest
#> 1      EWRIAH
#> 2      LGAIAH
```

### Group-by

Starting from `{disk.frame}` v0.3.0, there is `group_by` support for a
limited set of functions. For example:

``` r
result_from_disk.frame = iris %>% 
  as.disk.frame %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean(Petal.Length), 
    sumx = sum(Petal.Length/Sepal.Width), 
    sd(Sepal.Width/ Petal.Length), 
    var(Sepal.Width/ Sepal.Width), 
    l = length(Sepal.Width/ Sepal.Width + 2),
    max(Sepal.Width), 
    min(Sepal.Width), 
    median(Sepal.Width)
    ) %>% 
  collect
```

The results should be exactly the same as if applying the same group-by
operations on a data.frame. If not, please [report a
bug](https://github.com/xiaodaigh/disk.frame/issues).

#### List of supported group-by functions

If a function you like is missing, please make a feature request
[here](https://github.com/xiaodaigh/disk.frame/issues). It is a
limitation that function that depend on the order a column can only be
obtained using estimated methods.

## Example: data.table syntax

``` r
library(data.table)
#> data.table 1.13.6 using 6 threads (see ?getDTthreads).  Latest news: r-datatable.com
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'data.table'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:purrr':
#> 
#>     transpose
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:dplyr':
#> 
#>     between, first, last

suppressWarnings(
  grp_by_stage1 <- 
    flights.df[
      keep = c("month", "distance"), # this analysis only required "month" and "dist" so only load those
      month <= 6, 
      .(sum_dist = sum(distance)), 
      .(qtr = ifelse(month <= 3, "Q1", "Q2"))
      ]
)

grp_by_stage1
#>    qtr sum_dist
#> 1:  Q1 27188805
#> 2:  Q1   953578
#> 3:  Q1 53201567
#> 4:  Q2  3383527
#> 5:  Q2 58476357
#> 6:  Q2 27397926
```

The result `grp_by_stage1` is a `data.table` so we can finish off the
two-stage aggregation using data.table syntax

``` r
grp_by_stage2 = grp_by_stage1[,.(sum_dist = sum(sum_dist)), qtr]

grp_by_stage2
#>    qtr sum_dist
#> 1:  Q1 81343950
#> 2:  Q2 89257810
```

## Basic info

To find out where the disk.frame is stored on disk:

``` r
# where is the disk.frame stored
attr(flights.df, "path")
#> [1] "C:\\Users\\RTX2080\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Rtmpk3aGAr\\file3adc78655410.df"
```

A number of data.frame functions are implemented for disk.frame

``` r
# get first few rows
head(flights.df, 1)
#>    year month day dep_time sched_dep_time dep_delay arr_time sched_arr_time arr_delay
#> 1: 2013     1   1      517            515         2      830            819        11
#>    carrier flight tailnum origin dest air_time distance hour minute           time_hour
#> 1:      UA   1545  N14228    EWR  IAH      227     1400    5     15 2013-01-01 05:00:00
```

``` r
# get last few rows
tail(flights.df, 1)
#>    year month day dep_time sched_dep_time dep_delay arr_time sched_arr_time arr_delay
#> 1: 2013     9  30       NA            840        NA       NA           1020        NA

#> 1:      MQ   3531  N839MQ    LGA  RDU       NA      431    8     40 2013-09-30 08:00:00
```

``` r
# number of rows

#> [1] 336776
```

``` r
# number of columns
