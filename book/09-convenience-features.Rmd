## Convenience Features

### GUI for setting options

I wanted to make `{disk.frame}` as easy to use as possible. I often forget what options are available to me. So I've made a GUI

```r
setup_disk.frame(gui = TRUE)
```
which opens up a Shiny app where the user can choose the options.

### RStudio column name completion

```r
library(disk.frame)
mtcars.df = as.disk.frame(mtcars)

mtcars.df %>% 
  filter(<press tab>)
```

you can press tab in RStudio and it will show all column available

### Insert ceremony/boilerplace into code in RStudio

The below will insert the recommended ceremony code into your editor
```r
disk.frame::insert_ceremony() 
```
should insert

```r
# this willl set disk.frame with multiple workers
setup_disk.frame()
# this will allow unlimited amount of data to be passed from worker to worker
options(future.globals.maxSize = Inf)
```
