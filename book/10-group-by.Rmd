# Group-by in `{disk.frame}`

The group-by framework of [`{disk.frame}`](https://diskframe.com) has been overhauled in v0.3.0. It is now able to perform some group-by-summarize operations in one stage. In this chapter we will cover 

1. How to use one-stage group-by
2. Manual two-stage group and hard group-by

In the custom [one-stage group-by chapter](https://diskframe.com/articles/custom-group-by.html), we will cover

* The architecture of `{disk.frame}` and its implications for group-by
* How to define custom one-stage group-by functions and its limitations


## One-stage Group-by

A one-stage group-by is the same as group-by for data.frames. This would be unremarkable, if not for the limitations imposed by the disk-based nature of `{disk.frame}`.  Before v0.3.0 of `{disk.frame}`, one-stage group-by was not possible, and the user had to rely on two-stage group-by even for simple operations like `mean`. 

However, now that one-stage group-by is possible, there are still limitations and not all functions are supported out-of-the-box. Hence, in the next chapter we will describe how to define custom one-stage group-by functions.

An example of one-stage group-by:

```r
result_from_disk.frame = iris %>% 
  as.disk.frame %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean(Petal.Length), 
    sumx = sum(Petal.Length/Sepal.Width), 
    sd(Sepal.Width/ Petal.Length), 
    var(Sepal.Width/ Sepal.Width), 
    l = length(Sepal.Width/ Sepal.Width + 2),
    max(Sepal.Width), 
    min(Sepal.Width), 
    median(Sepal.Width)
    ) %>% 
  collect
```

It is important to note that not all functions that can run in `dplyr::summarize` would work automatically. This is because of how `{disk.frame}` works. Please see the next chapter on defining custom one-stage group-by functions to learn more.

### List of supported group-by functions

If a function you need/like is missing, please make a feature request [here](https://github.com/xiaodaigh/disk.frame/issues). It is a limitation that function that depend on the order a column can only obtained using estimated methods.

### Notes on One-Stage group-by

The results should be exactly the same as if applying the same group-by operations on a `data.frame`. If not then please [report a bug](https://github.com/xiaodaigh/disk.frame/issues).


## Group-by notes

The `disk.frame` implements the `chunk_group_by` operation with a significant caveat. In the `disk.frame` framework, group-by happens WITHIN each chunk and not ACROSS chunks. To achieve group by across chunk we need to put **all rows with the same group keys into the same file chunk**; this can be achieved with `hard_group_by`. However, the `hard_group_by` operation can be **VERY TIME CONSUMING** computationally and should be **avoided** if possible.

The `hard_group_by` operation is best illustrated with an example, suppose a `disk.frame` has three chunks
```
# chunk1 = 1.fst
#  id n
#1  a 1
#2  a 2
#3  b 3
#4  d 4

# chunk2 = 2.fst
#  id n
#1  a 4
#2  a 5
#3  b 6
#4  d 7

# chunk3 = 3.fst
#  id n
#1  a 4
#2  b 5
#3  c 6
```
and notice that the `id` column contains 3 distinct values `"a"`,`"b"`, and `"c"`. To perform `hard_group_by(df, by = id)` MAY give you the following `disk.frame` where all the `id`s with the same values end up in the same chunks. 

```
# chunk1 = 1.fst
#  id n
#1  b 3
#2  b 6

# chunk2 = 2.fst
#  id n
#1  c 6
#2  d 4
#3  d 7

# chunk3 = 3.fst
#  id n
#1  a 1
#2  a 2
#3  a 4
#4  a 5
#5  a 4
```

Also, notice that there is no guaranteed order for the distribution of the `id`s to the chunks. The order is random, but each chunk is likely to have a similar number of rows, provided that `id` does not follow a skewed distribution i.e. where a few distinct values make up the majority of the rows.

Typically, `chunk_group_by` is performed WITHIN each chunk. This is not an issue if the chunks have already been sharded on the `by` variables beforehand; however, if this is not the case then one may need a second stage aggregation to obtain the correct result, see *Two-stage group by*.

By forcing the user to choose `chunk_group_by` (within each chunk) and `hard_group_by` (across all chunks), this ensures that the user is conscious of the choice they are making. In `sparklyr` the equivalent of a `hard_group_by` is performed, which we should avoid, where possible, as it is time-consuming and expensive. Hence, `disk.frame` has chosen to explain the theory and allow the user to make a conscious choice when performing `group_by`.

```r
suppressMessages(library(disk.frame))
flights.df %>%
  hard_group_by(carrier) %>% # notice that hard_group_by needs to be set
  chunk_summarize(count = n(), mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm=T)) %>%  # mean follows normal R rules
  collect %>% 
  arrange(carrier)
```

## Two-Stage Group-by

Prior to `{disk.frame}` v0.3.0, there is no general support for one-stage group-by. Hence a two-stage style group-by is needed. The key is understand is the `chunk_group_by` which performs `group-by` within each chunk.

For most group-by tasks, the user can achieve the desired result WITHOUT using `hard = TRUE` by performing the group by in two stages. For example, suppose you aim to count the number of rows group by `carrier`, you can set `hard = F` to find the count within each chunk and then use a second group-by to summaries each chunk's results into the desired result. For example,

```r
flights.df %>%
  chunk_group_by(carrier) %>% # `chunk_group_by` aggregates within each chunk
  chunk_summarize(count = n()) %>%  # mean follows normal R rules
  collect %>%  # collect each individul chunks results and row-bind into a data.table
  group_by(carrier) %>% 
  summarize(count = sum(count)) %>% 
  arrange(carrier)
```

Because this two-stage approach avoids the expensive `hard group_by` operation, it is often significantly faster. However, it can be tedious to write; and this is a con of the `disk.frame` chunking mechanism.

*Note*: this two-stage approach is similar to a map-reduce operation.

```r
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(disk.frame))
setup_disk.frame()
```

```r
flights.df = as.disk.frame(nycflights13::flights)

flights.df %>%
  srckeep(c("year","distance")) %>%  # keep only carrier and distance columns
  chunk_group_by(year) %>% 
  chunk_summarise(sum_dist = sum(distance)) %>% # this does a count per chunk
  collect
```

This is two-stage group-by in action
```r
# need a 2nd stage to finalise summing
flights.df %>%
  srckeep(c("year","distance")) %>%  # keep only carrier and distance columns
  chunk_group_by(year) %>% 
  chunk_summarise(sum_dist = sum(distance)) %>% # this does a count per chunk
  collect %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(sum_dist = sum(sum_dist))
```

You can mix group-by with other dplyr verbs as below, here is an example of using `filter`. 

```r
# filter
pt = proc.time()
df_filtered <-
  flights.df %>% 
  filter(month == 1)
cat("filtering a < 0.1 took: ", data.table::timetaken(pt), "\n")
nrow(df_filtered)
```

## Hard group-by

Another way to perform a one-stage `group_by` is to perform a `hard_group_by` on a `disk.frame`. This will rechunk the `disk.frame` by the by-columns. This is **not** recommended for performance reasons, as it can be quite slow to rechunk the file chunks on disk.
```r
pt = proc.time()
res1 <- flights.df %>% 
  srckeep(c("month", "dep_delay")) %>% 
  filter(month <= 6) %>% 
  mutate(qtr = ifelse(month <= 3, "Q1", "Q2")) %>% 
  hard_group_by(qtr) %>% # hard group_by is MUCH SLOWER but avoid a 2nd stage aggregation
  chunk_summarise(avg_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  collect
cat("group-by took: ", data.table::timetaken(pt), "\n")

collect(res1)
```
