```{r include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  eval=TRUE,
  include=TRUE
)
```

### Steps to trouble shoot

1. I suggest updating {future} and your R version if you have not already done so.

2. Are you able to share the data?

3. Do a good MWE
```
library(disk.frame)
setup_disk.frame()

df<-as.disk.frame(a)


df1 = mutate(df, date = as.Date(as.character(datadate), format="%Y%m%d"))

head(df1)
```


3. Check if your virus scanner is blocking interprocess communication

4. Try to apply the function to just one chunk, perhaps there is a syntax error or column error? If one chunk works then you can rule out coding error

```
get_chunk(df, 1) %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(as.character(datadate), format="%Y%m%d"))
```

5. Set the number of workers to 1, so there is no more inter-process communication. Does it work now? If it does, then it's the inter process communication. You might need to contact your admin for help

```
setup_disk.frame(workers=1)
mutate(df, date = as.Date(as.character(datadate), format="%Y%m%d"))
As an MWE this works for me.

a = data.frame(datadate = rep("20201007", 3e6))
```
