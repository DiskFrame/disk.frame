# The story of how `{disk.frame}` came to be
I was working at one of Australia's biggest banks and their shiny new SAS server was experiencing huge instability issues. As a result, we had to run SAS on our laptops to perform huge amounts of data manipulation. A simple SQL query can take around 20 minutes.

I had enough.

That's why I created `disk.frame` - a larger-than-RAM data manipulation framework for R. The same query now only takes 10 seconds.
